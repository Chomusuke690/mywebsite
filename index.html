    <h2 style="font-size: 50px;">About myself</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">My name is Mark James B. Secondez, I'm 15 years old and my birthday is May 1, 2008. I was born in Lemery, Batangas but I live in Nasugbu Batangas. My type in a lady right now is an Eastern ABG (Asian Baby Girl) or in other words an japanese woman. If I could talk about my personality, I could say that im a nice guy and I don't start fights mainly because I can't throw a punch, I might consider myself as a mama's boy mainly because im so closed to my mother rather than my father but that doesn't mean i love them diffrently, Im also a very cheap person but I can make an effort on anything (I think efforts are more valuable than money because I put love on my efforts), another thing about me is that I can respond very quickly through chats because im glued to my phone, finally about me is that im a shy person that is full of insecurities about myself, I hate the way my face is not symetrical and the way I talk that it's always messy and thats the reason I have stage frights and social anxiety. My current hobbies right now are sewing, playing videogames and probaby coding since this is my first website that i created with the help of AI. When I grow up, I want to help my family about financial and helping them from their needs. After I gratuate college, I want to move to another country, to be specific Japan and if its posible i want to marry an japanese woman. Right now I don't know if im going to migrant there or not but I will let fate deside about my future. I have a fetish on a woman's back and probably a woman treating me a baby and I am not shy about other people knowing it, I also like a woman who sends cute emojis and GIFs when they type. I really like having someone I enjoy talking with and I give you this link so we can talk and let you know who I am </p>
    
    <h2 style="font-size: 50px;">If I like you</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 40px;">*NOTE*</p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">If I let you scan this or say like I like you, read this</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">If you have read this, yes I think your a really cute and a pretty lady, if i let you scan this, im shy and really want to know you alot and I link my social medias hehe, but if I talk to you about scanning it, im confident that I want to talk to you. Again I think your a really cute and pretty lady that I saw, I want to be friends with you if its posible and I want to know you alot. Im a really shy guy so this is the only thing that I can send to you I guess, I could probably say that I want to start knowing you first and probably rizz you up if your comfortable with it, if you probably accept me as like in a relationship, you'll be my first and final and I will promise to treat you as much as I treat myself or more. Another thing is that this is not serious if I send it to someone that I really know, its just here incase I fell inlove with someone.</p>
